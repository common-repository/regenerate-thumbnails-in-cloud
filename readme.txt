It can help in thumbnail rebuild using ajax and rebuilds entire site thumbnails. There are already some plugins available for this, but they have one thing in common: All thumbnails are rebuilt in a single step. This works fine when you dont have that many photos on your site. When you have a lot of full-size photos, the script on the server side takes a long time to run. Unfortunately the time a script is allowed to run is limited, which sets an upper limit to the number of thumbnails you can regenerate. This number depends on the server configuration and the computing power your server has available. When you get over this limit, you wont be able to rebuild your thumbnails.

Why would you want to rebuild your thumbnails? Wordpress allows you to change the size of thumbnails. This way, you can make the size of thumbnails fit the design of your website. When you change the size to fit for a new theme, all future photos you are going to upload will have this new size. Your old thumbnails wont be resized. Thats where this plugin comes into action. After changing the image sizes, you can rebuild all thumbnails. But instead of telling the server to recreate all thumbnails at once, they are rebuilt one after another. Rebuilding thumbnails for one photo wont take all too long, so you wont run into any script timeouts. Note that you still have to wait until all thumbnails have been rebuilt. If you close the page before the task is completed, you have to start all over again.

You can also select the thumbnail sizes you want to rebuild, so that you don't need to recreate all images if you've just changed one thumbnail-size. You can also choose to only rebuild post thumbnails (featured images).

plugin to generate Featured Image (AKA Post Thumbnail) from first image in a post or any custom post type content. The plugin will also create thumbnails from several popular Video services if it finds a Video embedded in the post.

Post Thumbnails is a theme feature introduced with Version 2.9 of Wordpress. It was quickly changed to Featured Images with Version 3.0. Post Thumbnail, now Featured Image, is an image that is chosen as the representative image for Posts. The display of this image is up to the theme. Most Modern themes now use featured images in a variety of ways.

This plugin DOES NOT extract thumbnails/featured image from custom field or anywhere else.
